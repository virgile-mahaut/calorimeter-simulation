* @page calo_sshape Energy deposition positions reconstruction in the calorimeter
*
* @tableofcontents
*
* The first part of the training has setup the simulation of the information measured by the calorimeter when an electron travels accross its volume.
* With these informations, one now needs to work on the information reconstruction before using the calorimeter data for physics analyses.
* First of all, one needs to find the positions in the calorimeter of the incoming particle.
* This part of work is what would be done in a real calorimeter with real data.
* For each event (i.e. for each electron entering the calorimeter), the calorimeter measures the energy deposited in each cell.
*
* 1. Using the calorimeter geometry description (i.e. the position in each cell) write a code to determine the impact position in the calorimeter.
* 2. The result (the reconstructed position), will be saved in the ROOT TTree (`eventTree`) of the exercise (which is written `Event.root`), by adding in the `Event` class two extra variables, `xReco` and `yReco`, which represent the reconstruct particle position (and functions to access them), as well as the corresponding branches to be written in `MainEvent.cxx`.
*
* For the following, it is important to have well-configured calorimeter parameters (mainly the size and division parameters), and shower size, as described in the simulation part.
*
* To simplify the problem, the impact positions of the electron at the entrance of the calorimeter will be generated between \f$[-0.1,0]\f$ in X and Y, which means that only one cell will be explored.
* The results will be studied first of all without noise, nor dead cells.
* The effect of the noise and dead cells, could be studied in a second step.
*
* In the `eventTree` of the ROOT file `Event.root` you will save:
* 1. the reconstruct energy (and the true one)
* 2. the reconstruct position xReco and yReco of this deposit (and the true positions). 
*
* @section calo_sshape_resolution_project Energy and position resolution
*
* - Project the data (Energy, X or Y) in a 1 dimension histogram (`TH1`).
* - Determine the energy and position resolutions fitting the histograms using an adjustment function of your choice, to be optimized (keep the results - parameters, errors, plots,... of the different tried fit). 
*
* @note Use the ROOT documentation! Some fit examples can be found there.
*
* @section calo_sshape_resolution_sshape S Shape distribution
*
* The S shape is defined by :
* \f[
Sshape(X_{reco}) = (X_{reco}-X_{true})
* \f]
* and similarly for the Y variable.
*
* One will start with the X reconstruction for example:
* 1. Plot the X S-shape: for that the ntuple variables can be retrieved in vectors using the ROOT `GetV1()` and `GetV2()` functions (other methods are also possible).
* 2. Adjust the S-shape with an appropriate function of your choice (like in the exercise 1, you may have to combine several functions to obtain the better fit).
* 3. Correct using the fitted shape function, the position of reconstructed events, and check that there is no bias anymore.
* 4. Evaluate the new position resolution after the S-shape correction.
* 5. Repeat the S-shape correction for the Y variable. 
*
* @section calo_sshape_resolution_cellsize Cell size
*
* To evaluate the influence of the cell size on the S shape, redo the simulation using different cell sizes and repeat the Step 2, in order to determine new resolutions on the corrected positions.
*
* @section calo_sshape_resolution_optimization Optimization of the reconstruction method (optional)
*
* This section can be skipped if you don't have time.
*
* Instead of correcting the reconstructed position with the S-shape, one can try to modify the formula used to estimate the position so that the S-shape correction is minimal:
* \f[
X=\frac{\sum(x_i E_i\alpha \log(E_i)\beta)}{\sum(E_i\alpha \log(E_i)\beta)},
* \f]
* with \f$\alpha\f$ and \f$\beta\f$ the optimized parameters (don't forget the case where \f$E_i=0\f$).
* 1. Code this new formula.
* 2. Perform the following measurements on the position resolution (in X only) with first (\f$\alpha=1/2\f$, \f$\beta=0\f$) and then (\f$\alpha=0\f$, \f$\beta=1\f$).
*   1. Resolution before the S-shape correction
*   2. S-shape parametrisation
*   3. Resolution after the S-shape correction 
* 3. Can you find the optimum values of \f$\alpha\f$ and \f$\beta\f$? 
*
* @section calo_sshape_resolution_subsidiary Subsidiary questions (optional)
*
* This section can be skipped if you don't have time.
*
* 1. The noise in the calorimeter cannot be neglected.
* Simulate a Gaussian noise with a RMS value of 5 GeV, every cell being affected in the same way by the noise.
* Re-evaluate the position resolution.
* 2. A high proportion (10%) of dead cell are present in the calorimeter (the energy deposition is the then null in these cells).
* The dead cells are the same for all events.
* Re-evaluate also the resolutions.
