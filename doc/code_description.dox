* @page code_description Code description
*
* - `MainEvent.cxx`: main program, must be modified to include more informations in `eventTree`.
* You can use it to test your classes.
* - `Event.h`, `Event.cxx`: the main class holding the simulation/reconstruction results.
* You will probably have to modify a bit this class at some point.
* - `simulate.cxx`: simulation (in the skeleton, only the simulated energy is defined).
* You will have to develop this file.
* - `reconstruct.cxx`: reconstruction (in the skeleton, the measured energy is drawn from a distribution centered around the "true" value).
* You will have to develop this file.
* - `CaloConstants.h`: list of useful definitions.
* You will probably have to modify a bit this file later. Not needed until next step.
* - `CaloCell.h`: represent a cell in the calorimeter.
* The corresponding implementation file (.cxx) has to be written.
* - `CaloGeometry.h`: implements the geometry of the calorimeter.
* The corresponding implementation file (.cxx) has to be written.
* - `CaloSimulation.h`: proceeds to the simulation of the calorimeter.
* The corresponding implementation file (.cxx) has to be written.
* - `Makefile`: file driving the compilation. Modify really carefully.
* - `ana_simu.cxx`: can be used to develop the analysis of your results (graphs...).
* - `ana.C`: ROOT macro to create graphs from the event.root file.
* This is not compiled by the Makefile (standalone ROOT macro).
*
* @section code_description_exercises Exercises
*
* 1. Store the resolution `(eReco-eTrue)` in a histogram.
* Does it match the distribution used in `reconstruct.cxx`?
* 2. In `reconstruct.cxx` replace the uniform distribution with a Gaussian (see the [ROOT documentation](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/index.html) and look for TRandom).
* 3. Fit the resolution with a Gaussian.
* 4. Is the sigma of the Gaussian the expected value? 
* 5. Introduce a new variable in `Event.h` (and `Event.cxx` ): `eRecoBias` fixed to be equal to `eReco`+0.1 GeV in `reconstruct.cxx`.
* 6. Fit `eRecoBias-eTrue`
* 7. Do you find the 0.1 GeV bias back?
