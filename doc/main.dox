* @section main_scope Scope of the project
*
* The goal of the computer project is to build a 3-step project as done in many experiments in particle physics:
*
* - Monte-Carlo simulation
* - Reconstruction
* - Particule identification
*
* In practice, a simplified calorimeter is used.
* The electron and hadron showers are simulated via Monte-Carlo simulation technics.
* The second step is to reconstruct the particles in the calorimeter and to study their performance (S shape, energy resolution...).
* The last step of the project is to identify variables to discriminate electrons (signal) and hadrons (background).
*
* @section main_documentation Documentation
*
* [ROOT](https://root.cern/) libraries are used as a toolbox to perform the analysis.
* See also the [C++ class documentation](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/index.html)
*
* @section main_evaluation Evaluation
*
* The computer project is evaluated with the following criteria:
* - code (14/20)
*   - implementation of the methods (7/20)
*   - diagnostic plots to check that the code is producing sane results (4/20)
*   - code optimization (1/20)
*   - code cleanliness and documentation (2/20)
* - final presentation (6/20)
*
* In your final presentation you should:
* - describe the project and the methods
* - explain your choices to implement the methods in your code
* - show snippets of code to explain your implementation
* - show diagnostic plots to prove your code is working as expected
*
* @section main_environment Environment
*
* For this project, you will have to install some software on your computer.
* Follow the instruction on @ref environment "this page".
