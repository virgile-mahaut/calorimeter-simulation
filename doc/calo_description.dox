* @page calo_description Calorimeter description
*
* Calorimeters are detectors used to measure energies of particles (except muons and neutrinos).
* To perform this, they stop completely the incoming particle and measure the deposited energy.
*
* A photon, electron or hadron meeting a significant amount of material interacts with the material and creates showers of particles which are progressively stopped and which deposit their energy.
* The shape of the shower depends on the particle type and on its energy.
*
* It is important to measure as much as possible the energy and the position of each particle in a given event.
* It is also important to measure the shape of the showers in order to identify the particle type.
* To do this, calorimeters are split into cells in which energy deposits are measured individually.
*
* For this project, it is proposed to perform a simplified simulation of showers of electrons in a calorimeter, and to develop an algorithm to reconstruct the position of the impact point of the electron at the front surface of the calorimeter from the energies deposited in the cells.
* Real calorimeters as the ones found in particle physics experiments, are too complex to be implemented for this project.
* Therefore, we will simulate a simplified calorimeter, made of one rectangle of material splitted into cells, as illustrated below:

*
* The front face of the calorimeter is in the (X,Y) plane and extends from `XYMin` to `XYMax`.
* It is segmented along the 2 axis into `NbCellsInXY` cells.
* The depth of the calorimeter extends from `Z=0` to `Z=Zmax` and is divided into `NbLayers` layers.
* As a first step, only one layer will be considered.
* It is however important to consider as early as possible that the calorimeter can be segmented into more than one layer.
*
* Units are meter and GeV.
